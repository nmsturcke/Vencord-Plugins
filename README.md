# Vencord-Plugins
Plugins that aren't added to Vencord, but are incredibly useful!

To add these plugins, you will need to clone [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord), and create a `userPlugins` folder in the `src` directory, and create files/folders with the user plugins you want in there!

## Compiling & Injecting Vencord
You will need to compile Vencord by running `pnpm build` in the Command Line, and then inject it by running `pnpm inject` and using the installer.
